He had arms and legs and hands and feet
This boy whose name was Eno
And he grew, grew, grew and grew
Grew up to be
Yes he grew up to be
A teenager called Eno
A teenager called Eno
And his face became spotty
Yes his face became spotty
And his voice dropped down low
And things started to grow
On young Eno and show
He was certainly no
No girl named Eno
Not a girl named Eno
